Stanford Cars dataset

Thanks for reading this submission. I have employed the latest EfficientNets to train the model and did minor fune-tuning. The accuracy of the model converged to 95% which is very impressive.

This has been an enjoyable exercise as it is my first DL project after attending a 2 day SGInnovate course titled "Deep Learning Jump-Start Workshop" and I hope that this submission could show my keen interest in joining Grab. Thank you.
